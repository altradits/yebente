# Ye₿ente

**Hard Money for the African Household.**

Ye₿ente is an open, sovereign financial settlement interface connecting Bitcoin (Satoshis) directly to East African mobile money networks: Safaricom M-Pesa in Kenya and Ethio Telecom Telebirr in Ethiopia.

We are not here to build another extractive financial intermediary. We are here for monetary liberation. Starting in East Africa, Ye₿ente dismantles predatory cross-border remittance monopolies and currency debasement, giving everyday households direct, sovereign access to borderless digital bearer money.

## What Ye₿ente Stands For

1. **The Name: Ye - ₿ - ente**
   - **"Ye" (የ)**: In Amharic and regional Horn of Africa languages, the prefix **"Ye-"** signifies **"belonging to"**, **"of"**, or **"for"** (e.g. *Ye-Bete* = of my house / for my home; *Ye-Sew* = of the people).
   - **"₿"**: The Bitcoin symbol at the heart of our name represents sound, unconfiscatable, inflation-resistant monetary freedom.
   - **"ente" / "bete"**: Anchors the concept of the African **Home, Household, and Family**.
   - **Together**: Ye₿ente means **"Money for the Home"**: capital that flows directly into the hands of the household without extraction by foreign financial gatekeepers.

2. **Monetary Liberation & Decolonization**
   - Sub-Saharan Africa suffers under the world's most punitive remittance rates, averaging 8.5% to 20% to send money across borders. Traditional wire transfers take 2 to 5 business days, routing through London or New York correspondent banks.
   - Ye₿ente eliminates the correspondent banking tax entirely. By using Bitcoin Satoshis over the Lightning Network as a neutral settlement rail, payments settle in under 15 seconds for a fraction of a percent.

3. **Stan Style: Radical Interface Clarity**
   - A mother in Moyale or a livestock trader in Marsabit should never struggle with confusing interfaces or deceptive buttons.
   - Ye₿ente enforces **Stan Style**: a strict minimalist design system where buttons display only direct user actions, back navigation has zero clutter, and non-interactive data is never disguised as buttons.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Non-Custodial Priority & Financial Sovereignty**
   - User self-custody is the default standard. Private keys are never held or processed on centralized servers.
   - Native support for standard Bitcoin address schemes: BIP-84 (Native SegWit) and BIP-86 (Taproot), alongside Lightning Network BOLT-11 invoices.

2. **Operational Authenticity (Zero Simulation)**
   - No mock data, no simulated transactions, and no artificial numbers exist anywhere in our production path. Every digit displayed originates from verifiable on-chain UTXO indexers, active WebLN extensions, or verified Safaricom/Telebirr gateway callbacks.

3. **Stan Style Design System**
   - Follows the official [Stan Style Specification](.agents/skills/stan-style/SKILL.md) and [Brand Development Kit](docs/BRAND_DEVELOPMENT_KIT.md).
   - Zero emojis, zero typographic dashes (standard hyphens and colons only), clean monospace figures for all financial amounts, and strict anti-confusion separation between interactive controls and informational readouts.

4. **Dynamic Brand Palette Engine**
   - Centralized theme architecture in [src/theme/brandKit.ts](src/theme/brandKit.ts) enabling developers to toggle and register production palettes (Obsidian Plum, Solar Amber, Kigali Emerald, Nile Slate) with full CSS variable propagation.
